# Sesame database

## How put data?
To add data, there are several steps:
### 1. Transfer the data to the Discord server.
Take the data you want and fill in the corresponding template in "resources" and copy it.
### 2. Add data to files.

There are 4 files:

- `codes.json` for code or tools.
- `mods.json` for mods.
- `communities.json` for communities.
- `users.json` for users.
- `ships.json` for ships.

Open the file that matches the pattern and paste it at the end of the file.
 
⚠️ **Be very careful with commas and parentheses. One error and the whole database is dead.** ⚠️

Once the changes are made, commit the commit.

### 3. Verification
Once the commit is complete, go to  [Sesame](https://w0lfan.github.io/sesame/) and verify that the changes are made.

⚠️ It is normal that changes take a little time. Typically, the download time from validation to changes on the website is 60 seconds. ⚠️

⚠️ **If you see that the loading screen is infinite, you made a mistake with a comma or parentheses. They need to be repaired as quickly as possible before anyone notices.** ⚠️
